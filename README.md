#BagUtil

Addon designed to make opening and selling junk bags from question in *Secret World Legends* easier!

BagUtil adds two buttons to the default inventory window. **Open** and **Sell**.

##Open

Will open all quest bags (Talisman/Glyph/Weapon) Reward Bag, until it runs out of bags or your inventory is full.

##Sell

Will sell all junk opened from the bags to a vendor with the following criteria. The Sell button will only become visible when you have a vendor window open.

* Item must be in the default inventory bag, items in other bags are ignored
* Item must be 1 or 2 pip only
* Item must be Standard quality (green)
* Item must be unbound
* Item must be unranked (no levels and no XP)
* Extraordinary items will be sold, but they will sell last (and be available in buyback)
